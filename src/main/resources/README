Overview

IrrigationForPi is a web app designed to allow you to control external lighting and irrigation systems from a mobile device.

The app allows you to configure Pins on the Pi to control various devices such as lights and values for an irrigation system.

In theory the app can be used to control any device attached to a Pi but it has specific interfaces that are fashioned around 
configuring irrigation and lighting systems.
