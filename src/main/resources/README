Installation

We recommend that you use tomcat to run the irrigation control on your raspberry pi using raspbarian.

To install using tomcat 8 

If youare using a different version of tomcat then substitute '8' for your version no. in each of the below commands.


sudo apt-get install tomcat8

# To provide tomcat access to gpio pins

sudo adduser tomcat8 gpio

Download the latest irrigation-XX.XX.XX.war file.
Rename the war to:
irrigation.war

Copy the war file into the tomcat 8 webapp directory.

cp irrigation.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps

Start tomcat

sudo service tomcat8 start

Tail the tomcat log to check that everything starts ok.

tail -f /var/log/tomcat8/catalina.out

You now should have a operation web application.
You can access the web app via:

http://<pi host name or ip>:8080/irrigation

Now that your system is up and running you need to click the 'Configuration' button and
define each of your Pin mappings.
You can also test each pin as you define it.
