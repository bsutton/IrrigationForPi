Overview

IrrigationForPi is a web app designed to allow you to control external lighting and irrigation systems from a mobile device.

The app allows you to configure Pins on the Pi to control various devices such as lights and values for an irrigation system.

In theory the app can be used to control any device attached to a Pi but it has specific interfaces that are fashioned around 
configuring irrigation and lighting systems.

It only takes a few minutes to get this web app up and running so give it a try :)

Contributes to this project are strongly encouraged so post your patches.



Installation

We recommend that you use tomcat to run the irrigation control on your raspberry pi using raspbarian.

To install using tomcat 8 

If you are using a different version of tomcat then substitute '8' for your version no. in each of the below commands.


sudo apt-get install tomcat8

# To provide tomcat access to gpio pins

sudo adduser tomcat8 gpio

Download the latest irrigation-XX.XX.XX.war file.
Rename the war to:
irrigation.war

Copy the war file into the tomcat 8 webapp directory.

cp irrigation.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps

Start tomcat

sudo service tomcat8 start

Tail the tomcat log to check that everything starts ok.

tail -f /var/log/tomcat8/catalina.out

You now should have a operation web application.
You can access the web app via:

http://<pi host name or ip>:8080/irrigation

Now that your system is up and running you need to click the 'Configuration' button and
define each of your Pin mappings.
You can also test each pin as you define it.
